    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="p1"> He was born in Wisconsin but has lived most of his life in
        California. He graduated from Pacific High School class of 1974 in San Leandro.
        Out of school, He entered into an apprenticeship in aircraft electronics at the Naval
        Air Station in Alameda. While he completed his apprenticeship and specialized in
        shipboard weather satellite receiving stations, he also attended several junior
        colleges in the area as a pre-engineering transfer student. After graduating with
        honors from Chabot College, he transferred to the University of California at Davis where he double majored
        in Chemical Engineering and Biochemistry/Molecular Biology.
        Out of college, he worked for various companies in the bay area as a project engineer specializing in
        industrial controls and systems integration. In 2002, having married a wonderful teacher from Ardenwood
        Elementary, Sari Millard, he decided to leave industry and enter the education profession. He attended the
        teacher credential program at CSU East Bay as a secondary science teacher and also completed a Master of
        Science degree in Instructional Technology. Later he returned to CSUEB to complete a second Master of Art
        degree in Multimedia Technology. Upon graduation from CSUEB, he began to work at American High
        School in 2003 where he is privileged to remain to this day. He also has continued to work as a freelance
        developer during the summers at Varian Medical Systems, Cisco Networking, and Lockheed Martin.
        At American HS, he began by teaching Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Earth Science, having California
        credentials in all science subjects as well as in math and computer technology. In 2007 He approached the
        district and convinced them to allow him start an engineering program at American HS. Aided by
        generous grants from Toyota, Cargill, and LAM, he started a Project Lead The Way program at American in
        2008 and helped create the Engineering Consortium at Mission Valley ROP to extend the program to our
        other high schools across Fremont. To date, American has the most developed Engineering and
        Computer Science program in the district which includes engineering courses in Robotics, Computer Aided
        Design, Engineering Principles, and Digital Electronics, and also the computer science classes Exploring
        CS, APCS Principles, and APCS Java programming. It has been his pleasure to start all of these classes
        and has worked hard to help recruit the best teachers to continue to teach them.
        This year he will be teaching DE and AP CSP as well as co-chairing the Technology Department with Ms.
        Wheaton. he also advise the Engineering Club, the Computer Science Club, Girls Who Code, the AI Club,
        the Technology Students Association, and the FTC Robotics Competition team.

     <h2> His Life </h2>
     <p class ="p2">As a child, Mr. Milard was very sweet, and well-behaved. He loved to sing, but as he says it, "not well". He joked that "he was told to insure his voice, but then a music lover went for his throat." Mr. Millard's favorite song was "Yesterday" by the beatles. Academically, he was a very good student. He experienced a bit of a bump in freshman year of high school, but then went back to being a good student. He loved science, especially astrophysics and geology (although he would never take these in college). He visited many countries, but his favorite visit was Italy. Mr. Millard is not a big sports fan, but he was a wrestler. He did not go proffessional (obviously, as he is with us now) and did not enjoy it very much. He was also a swimmer. Infact, he set the local record for backstroke. Mr. Millard does not like butterfly however. He said that "the founder of butterfly made butterfly so that people could drown." There were six kids in his household, five boys and one girl. He called them the quick and the hungry. </p>
<h2>The Creator of the American High Computer Science Department</h2>
<p class = "p4">Mr. Millard originally was a chemistry teacher when he first began at American High School. However, he would come to hear that the students wanted a CS program. He convinced the board to teach engineering and started introduction to electronic design. IED which is taught by Mr. Lindsay now, would be the first class Mr. Millard would create for American High School. He would then move to a Digital Engineering class, and then to a class called Software Engineering. Fun Fact: Software Engineering is actually the class we are in now. With the AP curriculum, Software Engineering had turned into AP Computer Science Principles. After creating CSP, he moved on to AP Computer Science A, which is now taught by Mrs. Sangam and Mr. Holcomb. After those classes, he would create Introduction to Computer Science, which is now taught by one of the greatest teachers of all time, Mrs. Wheaton. In Robotics, he personally created the curicculum for your class. Every year he gets funding for these classes, and recruits kids. Every year, he creates a new curicullum and a new class. In fact, this is the only year where he did not create a new class. He tried to create a new unit for Digital Engineering, but that failed badly. All in all, we should be thankful for Mr. Millard for being the modern-day father of the American High School Computer Science and Engineering Program. </p>
<h2>
    Life After American
</h2>
<p class = "p3"> Mr. Millard wants to work for three more years before he retires at the ripe age of 69. When he retires he wants to sleep for a few months, travel, and read books. He is a big fan of books with mgical realism. He reads Terry Pratchet, Douglas Adams, Phillip Pullman. He likes Ursilla Guin's "EarthSea" series. Hopefully Mr. Millard finds his happiness when he retires. </p>
