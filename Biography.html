    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p> He was born in Wisconsin but hase lived most of his life in
        California. He graduated from Pacific High School class of 1974 in San Leandro.
        Out of school, He entered into an apprenticeship in aircraft electronics at the Naval
        Air Station in Alameda. While he completed his apprenticeship and specialized in
        shipboard weather satellite receiving stations, he also attended several junior
        colleges in the area as a pre-engineering transfer student. After graduating with
        honors from Chabot College, he transferred to the University of California at Davis where I double majored
        in Chemical Engineering and Biochemistry/Molecular Biology.
        Out of college, he worked for various companies in the bay area as a project engineer specializing in
        industrial controls and systems integration. In 2002, having married a wonderful teacher from Ardenwood
        Elementary, Sari Millard, he decided to leave industry and enter the education profession. I attended the
        teacher credential program at CSU East Bay as a secondary science teacher and also completed a Master of
        Science degree in Instructional Technology. Later he returned to CSUEB to complete a second Master of Art
        degree in Multimedia Technology. Upon graduation from CSUEB, he began to work at American High
        School in 2003 where he os privileged to remain to this day. He also has continued to work as a freelance
        developer during the summers at Varian Medical Systems, Cisco Networking, and Lockheed Martin.
        At American HS, he began by teaching Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Earth Science, having California
        credentials in all science subjects as well as in math and computer technology. In 2007 I approached the
        district and convinced them to allow me to start an engineering program at American HS. Aided by
        generous grants from Toyota, Cargill, and LAM, he started a Project Lead The Way program at American in
        2008 and helped create the Engineering Consortium at Mission Valley ROP to extend the program to our
        other high schools across Fremont. To date, American has the most developed Engineering and
        Computer Science program in the district which includes engineering courses in Robotics, Computer Aided
        Design, Engineering Principles, and Digital Electronics, and also the computer science classes Exploring
        CS, APCS Principles, and APCS Java programming. It has been his pleasure to start all of these classes
        and has worked hard to help recruit the best teachers to continue to teach them.
        This year he will be teaching DE and AP CSP as well as co-chairing the Technology Department with Ms.
        Wheaton. he also advise the Engineering Club, the Computer Science Club, Girls Who Code, the AI Club,
        the Technology Students Association, and the FTC Robotics Competition team. </p>
