# CSP Website Project
This is the CSP Website Project, undertaken by Ayushman Chakraborty, Jeffrey Chao, and Arjun Arora. 
We took AP Computer Science Principles in the 2021 - 2022 School Year, and our final project for the fall semester was to work together to create a website. My group of three chose to create a website on our teacher, Mr. Millard. Our website had numerous pages for his biography and even had a javascript created quiz and a database backed shop.
